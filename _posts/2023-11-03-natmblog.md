# What went well
- We were able to get a good audience gathered around our presentation and they were all interested and learned about our project
- We had people engaged and were able to successfully demonstrate and shoawcase frontend and backend



# What could've gone better

- We could've done a better job in having the person actually test the user functionality and mess around with it
- We couldve improved on having parents involved in a conversational way
