## Key Assets and Projects

Worked on Cancer Research Project and Stock Analysis Fibonacci Project

### Cancer Research

For the first project of CSA, we started off strong with a Cancer Research Project which would include multiple features such as a body diagram, memorial, quotes, and a data table. The body diagram was inspired by the game called Operation, which was arguably our biggest component in our project. I believe this was a great start to CSA and a way to showcase the skills we have learned up to now, along with the new implementation of a Java backend.

### [Quotes](https://krishiv111.github.io/KPNSTeam/quotes/)
### [Memorial](https://krishiv111.github.io/KPNSTeam/memorial/)
### [Interactive Body Diagram](https://krishiv111.github.io/KPNSTeam/bodydiagram)

Our backend link can be found [here](https://kpns.stu.nighthawkcodingsociety.com/). All of us worked a lot in the backend, and I spent lots of time working on the quotes and memorial backend, as well as helping Nikhil with the interactive body diagram. We heavily faced CORS error and was non-stop struggling with CORS error. 

### Stock Analysis

The project we just completed before winter break was a very complex and tough project with the time we had, but we were finally able to figure it out. My review ticket is linked [here](https://github.com/divorced-coders/divorce-analysis-frontend/issues/5#issue-2035263414) where I worked on the sorting algorithm and the entire frontend.
