# Errors I faced

## CORS Error

``` 
Access to fetch at 'http://localhost:8098/api/monthly-stocks/chronological' from origin 'http://0.0.0.0:4200' 
has been blocked by CORS policy: The request client is not a secure context and the resource is in more-private 
address space `local`.
```

By implementing the Cross Origin link as the local host link and allowing access control to the origin via SecurityConfig is what allowed me to bypass the CORS error.

## Map function error

```
TypeError: monthlyData.map is not a function
    at fetchData
```

```
result.map is not a function
    at fetchData
```

By implementing and using the map feature in definition to generate the graph, using ctx graph allowed the map feature to be installed already and be utilized in displaying the graphs.
