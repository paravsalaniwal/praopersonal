### Code Qualifications

During my AP Computer Science assignments, I haveÂ improved at using a range of frameworks, languages, and libraries. I discuss a few below that I think are significant to this internship.

#### Python & Flask

My attention was more on the backend throughout my time in AP Computer Science Principles, and I really enjoyed using Python and the Flask framework.

#### SQL

Throughout my time in AP Computer Science courses, SQL database management has served as the foundation for every significant project I have undertaken.
