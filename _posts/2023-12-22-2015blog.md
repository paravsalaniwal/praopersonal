# Question 4

Why my answer was incorrect: If the largest value in arr was zero, the algorithm would work correctly since maxVal starts at the largest value.

Why C is the correct answer: Since maxVal is initialized to a value that is greater than all values in arr, maxVal will never be updated and 0 will be returned. To correct this, maxVal could be initialized to the first element in arr or initialized to Integer.MIN_VALUE.

# Question 8

Why my answer was incorrect: This would be the result if the array results were assigned the products in the opposite order that they are calculated. In other words, for each value of j, the calculated product was assigned to result[result.length â€“ 1 - j].

Why B is the correct answer: In the first iteration of the for loop, j is 0. The value of result[0] is assigned the product of row 1, column 0, which is 1 and row 0, column 2, which is 1. Therefore, result[0] is assigned the value 1. The second iteration of the for loop, when j is 1, result[1] is assigned the product of row 1, column 1, which is 2, and row 1, column 2, which is 3. Therefore, result[1] is assigned the value 6. The third iteration of the for loop, when j is 2, result[2] is assigned the product of row 1, column 2, which is 3, and row 2, column 2, which is 1. Therefore, result[2] is assigned the value 3. The final iteration of the for loop, when j is 3, result[3] is assigned the product of row 1, column 3, which is 4, and row 3, column 2, which is 1. Therefore, result[3] is assigned the value  4.

# Question 9

Why my answer was incorrect: This would result in an integer between 0 and 10 inclusive, since (int)(Math.random() *6) generates an integer between 0 and 5 inclusive. While it does represent two independent random numbers being generated, to simulate the rolling of two number cubes, the value of each number should be between 1 and 6 inclusive to produce a sum in the range of 2 to 12.

Why E is the correct answer: The call Math.random() will produce a double between 0 and 1, not including 1. To generate a random number in the range of 1 to 6, the call Math.random() needs to be multiplied by the number of integers you want to generate, in this case 6, giving us Math.random() * 6. This will result in a double between 0 and 6, not including 6. If we type cast this to an int, as in (int)(Math.random() * 6), the result will be an integer between 0 and 5 inclusive. Adding 1 will adjust the range to 1 to 6 inclusive, as in (int)(Math.random() * 6) + 1. This expression will simulate the rolling of one number cube. Since each roll is independent, to simulate rolling two number cubes, we need to use this expression twice which simplifies to 2 + (int)(Math.random() * 6) + (int)(Math.random() * 6).

# Question 13

Why my answer was incorrect: This would be the result if the loop incremented by 1 instead of 3 (the value of x.)

Why C is the correct answer: The values of the loop control variable k starts at 1 and is incremented by 3 as long as k is less than numbers.length. As a result, k will have the values 1, 4, 7 and then when it becomes 10, the loop will end. Only the values in numbers at indexes 1, 4, and 7 will be updated to the value of the sum of the element at the index that is one less than k (the element before the one being updated) and 3. So, numbers[1] will be assigned the value of numbers[0] + 3 or 20, numbers[4] will be assigned the value of numbers[3] + 3 or 45, and numbers[7] will be assigned the value of numbers[6] + 3 or 51. All other values will be unchanged.
