## Key Assets and Projects

I'll be only focusing on my work from this year, as I think it provides more relevant evidence of key indicators.

### Silver Screen Stats

This was the first project that we took on getting into the year, so I wanted to mention it. It doesn't work anymore (the API key expired), but we had a fully functional game in which you would try to guess which movie, between two movies, had a higher IMDb score. We even had a game currency system that would let the user customize their mouse. I think it shows some initial passion for making interesting, unique things early on in the year.

### [DADDiJktra](https://csa-tri-1.github.io/DADDiJkstra-frontend/pages/app)

This was the first main project of the year and absolutely the most complicated one I've taken on so far. I was primarily the backend developer, so I worked fairly closely with the Dijktra algorithm code while primarily focusing on the user login system.

Our backend is no longer deployed, but [this page](https://csa-tri-1.github.io/DADDiJkstra-frontend/pages/signin) was where most of my work went (at least from the backend). I showed a good commit related to the project later in this blog, but I wanted to say that working on the login system was absolutely critical to me learning how to use Java in the backend, especially when it came to using JWT and Spring Security. I had a lot of problems with data staying persistent or breaking the database when they were deleted (due to a bad workaround I found for passwords not being encrypted with certain creation methods), but I was able to fix them all before the project was due to be finished.

### Palette Puzzle

This was my most recent group project, and one that I think my contributions to were the strongest. My work on the [big simulation](https://madradium.github.io/MADRadium-DevLogs/bigSim/) page requires strong understanding of both frontend-backend connection (i.e., what data to send) as well as the sorting algorithms themselves. I go over a big backend commit related to sorting algorithms in the key commits section.

## College Board Prep

I wanted to use this section to show my College Board quiz reflections and trimester 1 lesson grades, the latter of which being important because they're a reflection of my work toward understanding the specific lesson topics.

### College Board MCQ 1

[Click here](https://drewreed2005.github.io/dre2//2023/11/03/CB_Quiz_Tri_1.html) to see the reflection. I got 38/40.

### College Board MCQ 2

[Click here](https://drewreed2005.github.io/dre2.0//2023/12/21/CB_MC_2015_Reflection.html) for the second reflection. This one was more recent, so it's fresh on my mind to talk about.

### Tri 1 Lesson Grades

[Click here](https://drewreed2005.github.io/dre2//2023/11/03/Student_Scores_Tri_1.html) for the blog with lesson grades. All lesson blogs individually are in my old blog's timebox. The most recent lessons are also relevant, but we just went over that.

## Organization

### Timebox

I recently moved my work over from the original GitHub Pages template to Teacher 2.0, which is the blog you're seeing now. I'm going to style it soon, I promise. As a result of the move, most of my timebox from the rest of the year is found on my old site, not this one.

[Click here](https://drewreed2005.github.io/dre2/csa) for the majority of my work earlier in the year.

[Click here](https://drewreed2005.github.io/dre2.0/AA_csa.html) for my most recent work organized in a timebox. Because the move was so recent, I only really have blogs from the most recent student lessons.

### Issues and Scrum Boards

One thing I think I've improved at a lot since the beginning of the year is creating review tickets and organizing Scrum Boards for projects.

My [DADDiJkstra](https://github.com/orgs/CSA-Tri-1/projects/3) Scrum Board was set up by David, who helped me a lot with understanding useful tools like milestones and issue flags, but I contributed a lot to it. I was mostly responsible for [planning the demonstration video](https://github.com/orgs/CSA-Tri-1/projects/3?pane=issue&itemId=40188539) and the [qualification review ticket](https://github.com/orgs/CSA-Tri-1/projects/3?pane=issue&itemId=43409888).

I was entirely responsible for the [mini-project Scrum Board](https://github.com/orgs/MADradium/projects/1/views/1?layout=board), but this is one I think I could have improved upon greatly. While the individual issues that were created made sense, I didn't do a good job enforcing that things should be added to the issue (replies and edits) to show progress, so most stayed the same as they were when they were first created. I did make edits to the [backend issue](https://github.com/orgs/MADradium/projects/1/views/1?layout=board&pane=issue&itemId=44754377) and I think I did a great job with all of the ticket issues (see rightmost section), but ultimately, I think it could have been organized and utilized better.

## Github Commits

[Here's a link to my profile](https://github.com/drewreed2005?tab=overview&from=2023-12-01&to=2023-12-31) so you can see for yourself, but I have been consistently making commits throughout the year on various repositories. However, this is the area that I want to improve on the most. I make a small number of very large commits, rather than splitting them up into smaller commits, even though I know not to do that. I'm going to work on improving on that as we approach the end of the school year.

## What am I Passionate About?

For our upcoming project, I'm aiming to challenge myself more to do better. Our group is enthusiastic about creating a teacher/student resources website specifically useful for Del Norte, with a focus on computer science and peer response. We're considering integrating features that might require some in-depth research and expertise, such as a built-in system similar to RateMyProfessor to help students decide if they feel like they belong in the class

The idea of developing a website that could have a noticeable impact on our school community, especially if effectively marketed, is particularly motivating for me. I believe this project will not only push my boundaries but also provide valuable resources for our school, enhancing the learning experience for both teachers and students.
