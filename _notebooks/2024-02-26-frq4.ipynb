    "(a) A number group represents a group of integers defined in some way. It could be empty, or it could contain one or more integers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Write an interface named NumberGroup that represents a group of integers. The interface should have a single contains method that determines if a given integer is in the group. For example, if group1 is of type NumberGroup, and it contains only the two numbers -5 and 3, then group1.contains(-5) would return true, and group1.contains(2) would return false.\n",
