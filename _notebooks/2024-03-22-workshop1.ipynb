    "a) Both person1 and person2 are references to objects of type Person.\n",
    "\n",
    "b) Yes, person1 and person3 point to the same value in memory. When you assign person1 to person3 (`Person person3 = person1;`), you're not creating a new object, but rather making person3 refer to the same object as person1.\n",
    "\n",
    "c) The integer \"number\" is stored in the stack. Primitive types like integers are typically stored in the stack memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "d) The value that \"person1\" points to (an instance of the Person class) is stored in the heap. Objects in Java are stored in the heap memory. So, person1 stores a reference to the actual object in the heap where the data for that person is stored."

    "(a) **Primitive Types vs Reference Types in Java:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Primitive Types**: These are basic data types provided by Java, which are used to store simple values. Primitive types are not objects and are predefined by the language. They include `int`, `double`, `boolean`, `char`, etc. Examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "int num = 10;\n",
    "double price = 20.5;\n",
    "boolean isValid = true;\n",
    "char grade = 'A';\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Reference Types**: Reference types refer to objects in Java. They store references (memory addresses) to objects rather than the actual objects themselves. Examples of reference types include classes, interfaces, arrays, etc. Examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "String name = \"John Doe\";\n",
    "Customer customer = new Customer();\n",
    "ArrayList<Integer> numbers = new ArrayList<>();\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "(b) **Differences between Primitive Types and Reference Types:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Memory Allocation**:\n",
    "  - **Primitive Types**: Primitive types are allocated memory on the stack. The actual value is stored directly in memory.\n",
    "  - **Reference Types**: Reference types are allocated memory on the heap. The reference variable itself is stored on the stack, while the actual object is stored in the heap.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Usage**:\n",
    "  - **Primitive Types**: Primitive types hold the actual value. Operations performed on primitive types directly manipulate their values.\n",
    "  - **Reference Types**: Reference types hold references to objects. Operations performed on reference types often involve accessing and modifying the object's properties or calling its methods indirectly through the reference.\n",
    "\n",
    "(c) **Method Signature and Implementation**:\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "public class BankApplication {\n",

    "#### (a) Purpose and Utility of the Math Class in Java Programming\n",
    "\n",
    "The `Math` class in Java provides a set of methods for performing common mathematical operations. It serves as a utility class for mathematical computations, offering functions for basic arithmetic, trigonometry, exponential, logarithmic, and rounding operations. Here are examples of three methods provided by the `Math` class:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`Math.abs(double a)`**: This method returns the absolute value of a given number. It disregards the sign of the number and returns its positive equivalent. For example:\n",
    "   ```java\n",
    "   double number = -10.5;\n",
    "   double absValue = Math.abs(number); // absValue will be 10.5\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **`Math.pow(double base, double exponent)`**: This method returns the value of the first argument raised to the power of the second argument. It's used for exponentiation. For example:\n",
    "   ```java\n",
    "   double base = 2.0;\n",
    "   double exponent = 3.0;\n",
    "   double result = Math.pow(base, exponent); // result will be 8.0 (2^3)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **`Math.sin(double a)`**: This method returns the sine of a given angle in radians. It's useful for trigonometric calculations. For example:\n",
    "   ```java\n",
    "   double angleInRadians = Math.PI / 6; // 30 degrees in radians\n",
    "   double sinValue = Math.sin(angleInRadians); // sinValue will be 0.5\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### (b) Method Implementation: `calculateSquareRoot`\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "/**\n",
    " * Calculates the square root of a given double number using the Math class.\n",
    " *\n",
    " * @param number The input number whose square root needs to be calculated.\n",
    " * @return The square root of the input number.\n",
    " */\n",
    "public static double calculateSquareRoot(double number) {\n",
    "    // Using Math.sqrt() to calculate the square root\n",
    "    double squareRoot = Math.sqrt(number);\n",
    "    return squareRoot;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The method `calculateSquareRoot` takes a `double` parameter `number` for which the square root needs to be calculated.\n",
    "- Inside the method, `Math.sqrt()` is used to compute the square root of the input number.\n",
    "- The calculated square root is returned as the result of the method."
